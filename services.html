                <h2>Illustration</h2>
                <p>One of the girst areas of graphic design I learned and specialized in is Illustration. Early on when I started getting into design, I was a very big drawer/painter, therefore this was the most welcoming and least daunting approach for me. That said, over the years that I have been doing freelance design, I have taken these skills, harnessed them, and expanded on them in ways that I never thought possible. We specialize in illustration of any form and style!</p>

                <h2>Flyers</h2>
                <p>Over the past few years, I have gotten much more in tune and adept with Adobe Photoshop. With that, I have acquired many different skills within this program which includes psychadelic and grungey styles, as well as cleanly laid out compositions. This is one of my absolute favorite areas of work.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h2>Logos</h2>
                <p>All my life, I feel that I have had a good eye for clean logos that match the brand's vision. That said, I aim to create logos that are clean, simple, and stand strong in black and white as well as color. Whatever your vision for the brand is, we can brainstorm ideas and bring a logo that you will love and will serve your brand for many years to come.</p>

                <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
                <p>Like mentioned in the logo section, we work hard to ensure that your brand's vision meets the vision you have in your minds eye. We want to pick up on themes, audiences, and colors that resonate with your brand in the best possible way. Moreover, we dont onlydo logo design- we can work together to build your brand from the ground up in the best possible way!</p>
